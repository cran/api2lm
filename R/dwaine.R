#'   community can be predicted from the number of persons
#'   aged 16 or younger in the community (\code{targetpop})
#'   and the per capita disposable personal income in the
#'   community (\code{dpi}). Data on these variables for the
#'   most recent year for the 21 cities in which Dwaine
#'   Studios is now operating are included in the data set.
